title: 'Authentication'

The Sales Journey API uses API keys and Secret to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Sales Journey Configuration.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via AWS Authentication Header pattern. To know more about the AWS Authentication, access the the [**AWS Documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html). 

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
