    On the top menu, click on <Icon icon="gear" size={16} /> **"Settings"**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third Step">
    Click on the **"Integrations"** menu.
    
    *If this menu is not available, open a ticket to request the API Key and Secret.*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Click on **"Access Keys"** and then on **"Request Access Key/Secret"**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fifth Step">
    Give a name to the Access Key/Secret.
